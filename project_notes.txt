Opensearch: search only KW indexes, return ATOM or RSS formated results
Opensearch + SRU: search all indexes and return ATOM or RSS formatted results
SRU: search all indexes and return MARC or XML results

What this project is:

Non-jargon:
	1. Come up with a search string that will find ebooks without unwanted junk results.
	2. Write a script that will combine the user's search terms with this string and format it so WorldCat can parse it.
	3. Get results from Worldcat and format in a user-friendly package.
	4. Deliver all of the above in a mobile-friendly package.

With Jargon:
	1. Format a Boolean search query that will return only items a "normal" patron would call ebooks in Worldcatlocal.
	2. Write a PHP script to combine this query with user-supplied keywords and send it to WorldCat using Opensearch and SRU standards.
	3. Tell Worldcat to return data formatted in RSS. Turn the RSS into user-friendly text.
	4. Use the jQuery Mobile framework to make it all look nice on tablets, phones, and on normal computer screens.
