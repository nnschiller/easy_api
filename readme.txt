Project requires MagpieRSS: http://magpierss.sourceforge.net/

Based on Jason Clark's WorldCat Search API: http://www.lib.montana.edu/~jason/files/worldcat-basic/what.php
	& Bruce Washburn's PHP Function for WorldCat API OpenSearch Requests http://www.oclc.org/developer/node/207
	
This project is a mobile search tool for library collections. The early edition is customized 
to use the WorldCat Search API to submit the complex Boolean search commands needed to limit
search results to items patrons will recognize as eBooks.
	
It still needs some work.
